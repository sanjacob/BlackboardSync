## Adding support for your university

In order to support your university, some information is first needed.


### Necessary data to add support

#### Basic Information

- **University name** (e.g. *University of Central Lancashire*).
- **Short name** or abbreviation (e.g. *UCLan*) if one exists.
- **Link to Blackboard portal** (e.g. *https://portal.uclan.ac.uk*).
- **Landing URL** after successfully logging in
  (e.g. *https://portal.uclan.ac.uk/ultra*).

#### Automatic Detection

In order to allow users to complete their setup process faster,
there is a built-in university detection system based on the
Internet Service Provider.
Note that this only works if you are currently connected to the
university network.
Fortunately, finding the required information is easy:

a. Visit our [automated checker][rdap-check] and note the result down.

b. **If the automated checker is not working**, follow these steps:

1. Find out your ip by visiting https://api.ipify.org/.
2. Visit https://rdap.org and enter your ip.
3. Note down the content of `Network Name`, `Country`, and `Remarks`.
   You can use `Ctrl+F` to find these fields.
4. Let me also know that the checker is down.


> There are [other fields](#advanced-fields) you can collect but
  I strongly suggest you skip these

## Footnotes



#### Advanced fields

- **Valid Blackboard data sources**

This is a tricky one because it can potentially help filter out dummy courses and other folders with no user content.

However, its usage may vary per institution, ultimately is not necessary, and if set incorrectly it may cause other users to not see any course at all.

You are fine without it and it is suggested to be skipped. If you have more information about how these are set internally, please let me know.

> To know this, you'll need to login to blackboard on a browser, and then visit the
> endpoint "/learn/api/public/v1/users/me/courses" on your university blackboard page.
> For instance, this might be: "https://portal.uclan.ac.uk/learn/api/public/v1/users/me/courses".
>
> Once on this page, you will see the list of courses you are registered for. Entries are of this form:

> ```json
> {
>   "id":"...",
>   "userId":"...",
>   "courseId":"...",
>   "dataSourceId":"_21_1",
>   "created":"...",
>   "modified":"...",
>   "availability":{"available":"Yes"},
>   "courseRoleId":"Student",
>   "lastAccessed":"..."
> }
> ```

>  Check the dataSourceId for all the entries returned and note down the one that appears most.
